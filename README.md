### Spicy Shrimp Avocado Bruschetta

#### INGREDIENTS
The ingredients for this shrimp bruschetta recipe are simple and easy to prepare. I like using ciabatta bread for the bruschetta but any bread like sourdough or even baguette will work. I used frozen whole shrimp that I peeled and deveined myself but any frozen and thawed shrimp will work. I seasoned the shrimp with Cajun seasoning, chilli flakes and lots of lemon but feel free to use any spices or seasoning you have.

- Shrimp. 
- Olive oil.
- Cajun seasoning. 
- Chilli flakes. 
- Lemon juice.
- Ciabatta bread. Sourdough, Italian bread or baguette can also be used.
- Avocado.
- Lemon juice. 
- Chives. Cilantro or coriander can be substituted.
- Salt and pepper.

#### HOW TO MAKE BRUSCHETTA WITH SHRIMP AND AVOCADO
1. **Cook the shrimp:** Peel and devein shrimp then pat dry with paper towels. Place in a bowl then add a few tablespoons of olive oil, Cajun seasoning, chilli flakes, salt and pepper. Toss to coat the shrimp in the seasoning. Place a large skillet or pan over medium-high heat then add the shrimp. Cook for a minute per side until golden and cooked through. Remove and set aside.
2. **Make the smashed avocado:** Halve the avocados then scoop the flesh from the skins. Season with lemon juice, chilli flakes, salt and pepper. Mash with a fork then set aside.
3. **Toast the bread:** Slice the bread into thick slices. Heat a few tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan set over medium-high heat. Add the bread and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute per side until golden and toasted. Alternatively, you can grill the bread in a griddle pan instead.
4. **Assemble and serve:** Spread a generous amount of avocado on each slice of bread then top with the shrimp. Sprinkle over chopped chives and finish with a squeeze of lemon. Serve immediately.
